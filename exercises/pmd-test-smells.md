# Detecting test smells with PMD

In folder [`pmd-documentation`](../pmd-documentation) you will find the documentation of a selection of PMD rules designed to catch test smells.
Identify which of the test smells discussed in classes are implemented by these rules.

Use one of the rules to detect a test smell in one of the following projects:

- [Apache Commons Collections](https://github.com/apache/commons-collections)
- [Apache Commons CLI](https://github.com/apache/commons-cli)
- [Apache Commons Math](https://github.com/apache/commons-math)
- [Apache Commons Lang](https://github.com/apache/commons-lang)

Discuss the test smell you found with the help of PMD and propose here an improvement.
Include the improved test code in this file.

## Answer

We did the following :

```bash
pmd check -d "C:\Users\PC\Desktop\commons-collections-master" -R category/java/bestpractices.xml/JUnitAssertionsShouldIncludeMessage -r checkStyle.html
[main] INFO net.sourceforge.pmd.cli - Log level is at INFO
[main] WARN net.sourceforge.pmd.cli - This analysis could be faster, please consider using Incremental Analysis: https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.0.0-rc4/pmd_userdocs_incremental_analysis.html
Processing files 100% [==============] 604/604 (0:00:33) Violations:0, Errors:0
Processing files 100% [==============] 604/604 (0:00:33) Violations:0, Errors:0
```

It tested if every assertion had a message in the commons-collections project.
No violations of this rule were found.

We decided to test another ruleset to ensure that pmd was working properly.

```bash
PS C:\Users\PC\Desktop\vv_tp3> pmd check -d "C:\Users\PC\Desktop\commons-collections-master" -R category/java/bestpractices.xml/JUnitUseExpected -r checkStyle.txt
[main] INFO net.sourceforge.pmd.cli - Log level is at INFO
[main] WARN net.sourceforge.pmd.cli - This analysis could be faster, please consider using Incremental Analysis: https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.0.0-rc4/pmd_userdocs_incremental_analysis.html
Processing files 100% [==============] 604/604 (0:00:27) Violations:6, Errors:0
Processing files 100% [==============] 604/604 (0:00:27) Violations:6, Errors:0
```

This generated a file with the following content :

```txt
C:\Users\PC\Desktop\commons-collections-master\src\test\java\org\apache\commons\collections4\collection\AbstractCollectionTest.java:1284:	JUnitUseExpected:	In JUnit4, use the @Test(expected) annotation to denote tests that should throw exceptions
C:\Users\PC\Desktop\commons-collections-master\src\test\java\org\apache\commons\collections4\iterators\AbstractMapIteratorTest.java:139:	JUnitUseExpected:	In JUnit4, use the @Test(expected) annotation to denote tests that should throw exceptions
C:\Users\PC\Desktop\commons-collections-master\src\test\java\org\apache\commons\collections4\map\AbstractMapTest.java:850:	JUnitUseExpected:	In JUnit4, use the @Test(expected) annotation to denote tests that should throw exceptions
C:\Users\PC\Desktop\commons-collections-master\src\test\java\org\apache\commons\collections4\map\AbstractMapTest.java:861:	JUnitUseExpected:	In JUnit4, use the @Test(expected) annotation to denote tests that should throw exceptions
C:\Users\PC\Desktop\commons-collections-master\src\test\java\org\apache\commons\collections4\map\AbstractMapTest.java:905:	JUnitUseExpected:	In JUnit4, use the @Test(expected) annotation to denote tests that should throw exceptions
C:\Users\PC\Desktop\commons-collections-master\src\test\java\org\apache\commons\collections4\map\AbstractMapTest.java:925:	JUnitUseExpected:	In JUnit4, use the @Test(expected) annotation to denote tests that should throw exceptions
```

We can see a warning for each test that does not use the `@Test(expected)` annotation.
A simple fix would be to add the annotation to each test supposed to throw an exception.
